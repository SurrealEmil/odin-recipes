# Odin Recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project aims to provide a hands-on experience in building a basic recipe website using HTML. By completing this project, I'll demonstrate proficiency in fundamental HTML concepts and practices.

## Project Description

The project consists of creating a simple recipe website with multiple pages. The main page, index.html, serves as the gateway to various recipes. Each recipe has its dedicated page within the recipes directory. The structure of each recipe page includes a heading, an image of the dish, a description, a list of ingredients, and a set of steps.

## Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

  - HTML Structure: Creating HTML documents with appropriate tags and elements to structure content effectively.

  - Linking Pages: Establishing navigation between different HTML pages using hyperlinks.

  - Image Integration: Embedding images into HTML documents to enhance visual presentation.

  - Text Formatting: Utilizing text formatting elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, etc., to organize and present information.

  - Directory Structure: Organizing project files into directories to maintain a well-structured codebase.

  - Version Control: Utilizing Git and GitHub for version control, including repository creation, cloning, committing changes, and pushing updates.

Through this project, I'll gain hands-on experience and confidence in building static web pages using HTML. It lays a solid foundation for future projects involving web development and serves as a stepping stone for incorporating CSS to enhance the visual appeal of websites.
